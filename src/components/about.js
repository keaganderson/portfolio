        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Keagan Anderson. I am a recent University graduate with a great passion for programming and problem solving. I graduated from the University of Washington with
          a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Systems. During this time I have completed numerous projects, both for classes and on the side following my interests or curiosities.
          I collected these projects here to better organize and display them. I also have a brother named Austin Robert Anderson who is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at
          Washington State University. He tends to sneeze a lot without covering his mouth and overall maintains low hygene practices.
